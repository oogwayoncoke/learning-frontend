Learning Frontend 🚀
A dedicated space for mastering modern frontend development, specifically focusing on React.js and Tailwind CSS. This repository documents my journey from understanding JSX syntax to building reusable, logic-driven components.

🛠 Tech Stack
React: Functional components, hooks, and props.

Tailwind CSS: Utility-first styling and conditional formatting.

JavaScript (ES6+): Destructuring, template literals, and ternary logic.

📖 What I've Learned So Far

1. The Anatomy of a Component
   Return Rules: Every component must return a single root element (or a <> Fragment </>).

ASI (Automatic Semicolon Insertion): Always use parentheses return (...) when returning multi-line JSX to avoid "undefined" return errors.

2. Logic & Styling
   Conditional Classes: Using JavaScript ternary operators within template literals to toggle styles based on state or props.
   Props & Children: Mastering the children prop to create "Wrapper" components and passing custom attributes like large or label to control UI.

📂 Project Structure
/src/components: Contains reusable UI atoms (Buttons, Boxes, etc.)

/App.js: The main entry point where components are orchestrated.
